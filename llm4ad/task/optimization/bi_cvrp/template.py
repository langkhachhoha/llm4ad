                        Each route starts and ends at the depot (node index 0), e.g., [0, 3, 5, 0].

                        representing the two objective values of the solution.
        
        coords: A numpy array of shape (n_nodes, 2), representing (x, y) coordinates of each node (depot + customers).
        demand: A numpy array of shape (n_nodes,), where demand[i] is the demand of node i. The depot has demand 0.
        distance_matrix: A numpy array of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes), where [i][j] is the Euclidean distance between node i and j.

task_description = "You are solving a Bi-objective Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (Bi-CVRP), where a single depot and multiple customers are located in 2D space. \
Each customer has a positive demand, and all vehicles in the fleet have identical capacity limits. The objective is to construct a set of routes, each starting and ending at the depot, \
such that all customers are served, vehicle capacities are not exceeded on any route, and two conflicting objectives are minimized: \
(1) the total travel distance across all routes, and (2) the makespan, defined as the length of the longest individual route. \
Each solution in the archive is represented as a list of NumPy arrays, where each array denotes a single route (starting and ending with depot index 0), \
and is paired with a tuple of two objective values (total_distance, makespan). \
Your task is to implement a function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one promising solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a feasible neighbor solution from it. \
Do not choose a solution or neighbor modification randomly. Instead, apply an intelligent strategy to identify a solution with potential for local improvement, \
and using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself. Avoid standard methods like pure 2-opt; instead, invent or combine transformations. Ensure that the returned neighbor solution remains feasible under the vehicle capacity constraint. \
The function should return the new neighbor solution."
