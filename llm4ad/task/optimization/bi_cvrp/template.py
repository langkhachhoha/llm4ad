task_description = "You are solving a Bi-objective Travelling Salesman Problem (bi-TSP), where each node has two different 2D coordinates: \
(x1, y1) and (x2, y2), representing its position in two objective spaces. The goal is to find a tour visiting each node exactly once and returning \
to the starting node, while minimizing two objectives simultaneously: the total tour length in each coordinate space. \
Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a numpy array representing a TSP tour, and its corresponding objective \
is a tuple of two values (cost in each space), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive \
and generates a neighbor solution from it. Do not choose randomly. Instead, think about how to identify a solution that is promising for further  \
local improvement. Using a novel or creative strategy â€” not necessarily 2-opt. You can try swap, reinsertion, segment relocation, or invent your own local \
transformation logic.  The function should return the new neighbor solution."
