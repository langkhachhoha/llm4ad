task_description = "You are solving a Tri-objective Travelling Salesman Problem (bi-TSP), where each node has three different 2D coordinates: \
(x1, y1), (x2, y2) and (x3, y3), representing its position in three objective spaces. The goal is to find a tour visiting each node exactly once and returning \
to the starting node, while minimizing three objectives simultaneously: the total tour length in each coordinate space. \
Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a numpy array representing a TSP tour, and its corresponding objective \
is a tuple of three values (cost in each space), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive \
and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. Do not choose randomly. Instead, think about how to identify a solution that is promising for further  \
local improvement. Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself. Avoid standard methods like pure 2-opt; instead, invent or combine transformations. The function should return the new neighbor solution."
