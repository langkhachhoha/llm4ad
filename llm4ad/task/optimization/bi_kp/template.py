task_description = "You are solving a Bi-objective Knapsack Problem (BI-KP), where each item has a weight and two profit values: \
value1 and value2. The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity, while \
simultaneously maximizing the total value in both objective spaces. \
Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a binary numpy array indicating item inclusion (1) or exclusion (0), \
and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (total value1, total value2), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive \
and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. \
Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, \
i.e., the total weight must not exceed the knapsack capacity \
Do not choose randomly. Instead, think about how to identify a solution that is promising for further  \
local improvement. Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself. Avoid standard methods like pure 2-opt; instead, invent or combine transformations. The function should return the new neighbor solution."
